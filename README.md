## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn)
*   A modern web browser
*   A Google Gemini API Key. 

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/geopolitical-analyser.git
    cd geopolitical-analyser
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    This project requires an API key to communicate with the Gemini API. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your key:
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    *The application is configured to access this key via `process.env.API_KEY` in a compatible hosting environment.*

3.  **Run the application:**
    You will need a local web server to run this project. A simple way is to use `serve`:
    
    ```sh
    # Install serve globally if you haven't already
    npm install -g serve
    
    # Run the server from the project root
    serve
    ```
    The application will then be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is taken).
